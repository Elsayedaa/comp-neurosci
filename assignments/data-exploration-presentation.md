The overall goal of the data exploration assignment is for you to use a public data set to address a specific hypothesis about how the brain performs computations. Given the time constraints of the class, *you are only expected to make progress toward this goal*, by pursuing a specific aim that you defined in your proposal.

Your submission will consist of two parts: code that you push to your github repository, and a 15-minute presentation that describes your question and results. The code will account for 40% of the assignment credit, and the report for 60%.

# Code

Your github repository will need to contain a notebook that generates the figure(s) you present in your report. This notebook must be at the top level of the repository and be clearly named. I will evaluate your submission by cloning the repository, following your instructions in `README.md` and/or `data/README.md` to retrieve the data set, and then executing the notebook. Your notebook needs to work for you to receive full credit, so make sure that someone following your instructions with a clean install can duplicate your results. I will mostly be evaluating this part of the assignment based on results, but 10% of your score will reflect whether your code is readable and appropriately documented.

# Presentation

Each team will present a report on their project in a colloqium format. That is, you should assume that your audience knows very little about your topic, and therefore needs to have the significance of the study and the methods explained at a basic level.

You will need to prepare slides and orally present them. Every member of the group must speak for part of the presentation. The presentation needs to have the following structure:

## Background

Begin by defining the overarching goal/question you are addressing in a way that emphasizes its significance to understanding neural computations and what is known already in the field. Use what is not known to motivate the specific question you worked to answer, and end by clearly stating what your objective was.

## Methods

Introduce your data set and describe how it was collected and organized. Describe the specific analysis you performed and how it relates to your objectives/aims for the project.

## Results

Succinctly describe the results of your analysis. You need to have at least one data figure that your team generated. Axes must be clearly labeled and legible, but you will also need to walk your audience through the figure, explaining what it is showing and how the results relate to the question/hypothesis.

## Discussion

Interpret your results in light of your hypothesis. Describe any limitations or unexpected outcomes, and summarize what the next step would be in addressing the hypothesis or general research question.

## Acknowledgments

Acknowledge the experimenters who collected the data you used, and any assistance you received from classmates not on your team.

## Questions

Plan to take questions from the class for 3-5 minutes. I expect everyone in the class to ask at least one question, and part of your score on the presentation will be based on this.
