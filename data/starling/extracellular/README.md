This directory includes raw neural response data for selected units. The goal is for students to see how neural responses align with stimuli and extract spikes under a range of SNR conditions.

## Neurons

1. st348_2_7_2/st348_1 - L3, very selective, channel has two units on it (st348_7_2_1)
2. st348_4_1_3/st348_3 - NCM/CLM, pretty selective; channel has another smaller unit on it (st348_4_1_4)
3. st11_1_2_1/st11_2 - CMM, very low spont, very selective
4. st268_2_1_4/st268_12 - CLM, very precise sparse firing
5. st268_5_2_1/st268_1 - L3, very selective
6. st49_4_2_3/st49_3 - CLM, fairly high spont, responds to a couple motifs.
7. st418_4_2_1/st418_1 - CMM, selective, bursty
8. st376_1_1_6/st376_8 - CMM, fairly high spontaneous rate, good isolation

### Alternates

st376_5_4_1/st376_1 - CMM, high spont rate
st467_5_4_1/st467_1 - CMM, pretty active, limited stimulus set

## Data processing

Extract the raw PCM data into wav files so that students can open in aplot or backyard brains "spikerecorder". Only want from the selected channels and only for stimuli of interest. May need to whip up a little script to do this. This is pretty trivial because the arfs all have the stimuli encoded in the entries.
